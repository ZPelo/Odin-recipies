    <p>Baked phyllo-wrapped feta with honey is sweet, salty, savory, creamy perfection. The other thing I love about this recipe is how versatile they are—fantastic as an appetizer, or, if you serve these for breakfast with coffee or tea, you are setting yourself up for a very successful day. You could also put a big salad next to one of these and have a delicious lunch or dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) block feta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 (13x18-inch) sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat, such as Silpat®.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cut block of feta in half, and then turn each half up on its side. Slice down to divide into 2 pieces each.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk egg, butter, and olive oil together in a small bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Lay 2 sheets of phyllo dough on counter, and brush evenly with egg mixture, covering about 75 to 80% of the surface.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place 2 pieces of feta side by side onto the dough, about 4 inches from the bottom edge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fold bottom edge of dough over feta and brush with egg mixture. Fold both sides over to the center, even with edges of feta. Brush with egg mixture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fold up, making a nice square, tight package, finishing with seam underneath. Repeat with the remaining phyllo and feta. Transfer both phyllo packets to the prepared baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Brush with egg mixture, and sprinkle top with sesame seeds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until well browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot, drizzled with honey.</p>
        </li>
